# ALS - Anonymous Life Stats

Anonymous Life Stats API and dashboard for Fitbit devices.

## How this project is different from all others?

If you take a look at the code of all other projects, you'll find that most of them are requesting the `profile` attribute from the Fitbit API which means that the devs can get private details about who you are.

__This is something I'm literraly against to!__

There is absolutely no need to request the `profile` attribute from the API to create and display charts with your data!

That's why I've decided to make this project and give a way for anyone to manage and display it's life stats safely and anonymously.

## Project status

The code is still in my mind for the moment but I want to make portable which means I'm gonna make it as a [PWA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps).

## Release date

Soon! üòÅ
